# gtk-custom-drawing-example-in-scala

This is a Scala port of the example application from https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/ch01s05.html

The java-gnome User Interface Library is needed to build and run the example.
On Ubuntu just install libjava-gnome-java. On other systems please make sure
that your /usr/share/java directory contains a file named gtk-4.1.jar (or
make the necessary adjustments to build.gradle).
